## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Recon (always first)

Map the motion surface before judging it:

- **Stack**: framework, motion libraries (Framer Motion / Motion, React Spring, GSAP, plain CSS, WAAPI), component libraries (Radix, Base UI, shadcn/ui).
- **Where motion lives**: global CSS/tokens (`--ease-*`, `--duration-*`), Tailwind config, keyframe definitions, `transition`/`animate` props, gesture handlers.
- **Conventions**: existing easing tokens, duration scales, spring configs — plans must extend these, not invent parallel ones.
- **Personality**: is this a playful consumer app or a crisp dashboard? Cohesion findings depend on it.
- **Frequency map**: which animated elements are hit 100+ times/day (command palette, keyboard shortcuts, list hover) vs. occasionally (modals, toasts) vs. rarely (onboarding). This drives severity.

Useful sweeps: grep for `transition`, `animation`, `@keyframes`, `motion.`, `animate={`, `useSpring`, `ease-in`, `transition: all`, `scale(0)`, `prefers-reduced-motion`, `transform-origin`.

### Phase 2 — Audit (parallel)

Audit against the eight categories in [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md):

1. Purpose & frequency
2. Easing & duration
3. Physicality & origin
4. Interruptibility
5. Performance
6. Accessibility
7. Cohesion & tokens
8. Missed opportunities

For anything beyond a small repo, fan out read-only subagents — one per category (or per app area for large monorepos). Each subagent prompt must include: the absolute path to AUDIT.md and its section heading, the recon facts (stack, motion libraries, token conventions, frequency map), an instruction to return findings only (file:line + evidence, no fixes), and Hard Rule 4 verbatim.

Depth follows effort level (default `standard`):

| Effort | Coverage | Subagents | Findings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quick` | High-traffic components only | 0–1 | ~5, HIGH severity only |
| `standard` | All interactive UI | ≤4 | Full table |
| `deep` | Whole repo incl. marketing pages | ≤8 | Full table + LOW polish items |

### Phase 3 — Vet, prioritize, confirm

Re-read the cited code for every finding yourself. Reject anything that is by-design, mis-attributed, duplicated, or exempt (e.g. `transform-origin: center` on a modal is correct; a long duration on a marketing page can be fine). Never present a finding you haven't confirmed at its file:line.

Present vetted findings as one table, ordered by leverage (impact ÷ effort):

| # | Severity | Category | Location | Finding | Fix summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Severity: **HIGH** = feel-breaking (wrong easing on UI, animation on keyboard/high-frequency actions, dropped frames, `scale(0)`); **MEDIUM** = noticeably off (wrong origin, non-interruptible dynamic UI, missing reduced-motion); **LOW** = polish (stagger, blur-masked crossfades, token consolidation).

After the table, list 2–4 **missed opportunities** — places that don't animate but should (a jarring state change, a rare delight moment) — separately, since they're additive rather than corrective.

Then **stop and wait for the user to select** which findings become plans. If running non-interactively, default to the top 3–5 by leverage.

### Phase 4 — Write plans

One plan per selected finding, using [PLAN-TEMPLATE.md](PLAN-TEMPLATE.md), written into `plans/` as `NNN-short-slug.md` (monotonic numbering; respect existing plans). Stamp each plan with the current commit (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`).

Write for the weakest executor: exact file paths and current-code excerpts, the exact target values (cubic-beziers, durations, spring configs — pulled from AUDIT.md, never approximated), the repo's own conventions with an exemplar, ordered steps, hard scope boundaries, and a verification section including how to *feel-check* the result (slow motion, frame-by-frame, real device for gestures).

Finish by creating or updating `plans/README.md`: recommended execution order, dependencies between plans, and a status column.
